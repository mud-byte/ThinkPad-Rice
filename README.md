# ThinkPad-Rice
This is the repository containing a rice for my ThinkPad.

I use the Graphite theme (https://github.com/vinceliuice/Graphite-gtk-theme), and the icon theme I use a modified version of Papirus-dark (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme and https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders). You can find the wallpaper I use here: https://wallhaven.cc/w/9o5kg8
