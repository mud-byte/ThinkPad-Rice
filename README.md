# ThinkPad-Rice
This is the repository containing a rice for my ThinkPad.

I use the Graphite theme (https://github.com/vinceliuice/Graphite-gtk-theme), and the icon theme I use is the Linux Mint L icons.(https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-l-icons). You can find the wallpaper I use here: https://wallhaven.cc/w/9o5kg8
